# Category Path Finder

A highly efficient utility function for finding the path to a category in a nested category structure.

---

## Overview

This utility provides a way to traverse complex nested category structures and find the path to a specific category by name. The implementation uses an **optimized iterative approach** with a **stack data structure** to ensure maximum performance and minimal memory overhead.

---

## Implementation Details

The `getCategoryPath` function accepts a nested category structure and a category name, then returns the full path to that category or `undefined` if not found.
